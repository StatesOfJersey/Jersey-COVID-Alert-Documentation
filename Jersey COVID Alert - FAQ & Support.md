## How to use the Pause function
The Pause function is designed to help you manage short periods when your phone might detect the present of other people, but there are very good barriers to transmission of the virus between you. Some specific instances include:

* you are alone in a room with thin walls while others are outside/next door
* you are alone in vehicle
* you are in a clinical setting wearing full, medical grade PPE (mask, googles, gloves, suit)
* you are protected by a fixed physical barrier from customers and colleagues such as a Perspex screen for the majority of the working day
* you leave your phone in a locker or somewhere else not on your person

The app should NOT be paused in the following scenarios: 

* when you are behind a small screen (e.g. at a check out, or counter) and you constantly move around (e.g. café workers behind tills with a screen who also move around the café) 
* where PPE, including visors and face coverings, is used in non-clinical settings (e.g. wearing masks in shops, building sites, cafés, by other health or official workers)

The Pause cannot be activated without setting a reminder, which can be up to 24 hours after pausing, although you can continue to pause after the reminder has been sent. If you are isolated from others, you may wish to set the reminder for your next break, when you leave your home, or when you know you will be around others again.

Please keep the app on as much as possible to protect yourself and others.

## How we know the app will work
The app is based on technology developed by Apple and Google. It is currently being used by more than fifty countries worldwide. 
The app was thoroughly tested before launch. There are three parts to the test programme: 
1.	Expert functional and security tests
2.	Expert user experience testing
3.	Public user experience testing

After launch, the app will be closely monitored to ensure it is working as intended using a mixture of survey data and limited app analytics.

## How you can check the app is working
When using the app with Exposure Notifications active – don’t be concerned if you don’t receive any Exposure Alerts – this is a good thing! You can always check that the system is working in the Exposure Notification Settings on your phone which will record the Random IDs it is exchanging in the background.

# How the app works
## What to do if you get an exposure alert

Remain calm.

Receiving an Exposure Alert does NOT mean you definitely have COVID-19. It means that you were near an infectious person for long enough and close enough for there to be a risk that you have the virus.

If you requested a call back when you set up the app, or later in Settings, the Contact Tracing Team will call you as soon as they can within social hours.

If you did not request a call back from the Contact Tracing Team, we encourage you to call the [Coronavirus Helpline on +44 (0)1534 44 55 66](tel:+441534445566) for support and advice specific to your situation.

You are not required to self-isolate if you get an exposure alert, but we encourage you to contact the Coronavirus Helpline for a test and to limit your interactions with others as you may put them at risk.

If you are very concerned about your health, call your GP or the [Coronavirus Helpline on +44 (0)1534 44 55 66](tel:+441534445566).

## What to do if you have COVID-19
If you are advised that you have COVID-19 following a diagnostic test, you can use the app to anonymously alert anyone you have recently been in close physical contact with, so they can take steps to prevent onwards infection.

When your test has been processed, the Contact Tracing Team will phone you to tell you your result as normal.

During that call, the Contact Tracer will ask if you are using the app. The Contact Tracer will also discuss your specific health situation, offer support where necessary, and conduct an interview to identify the direct contacts you can remember to ensure that anyone not using the app is also notified.

If you have the app, they will ask if you want to upload the Random IDs that your phone has shared for the last 14 days so that your close physical contacts using the app can be notified immediately of their exposure. If you consent, you will use the app to upload your Random IDs to the secure app servers to be made available to other apps, guided by the Contact Tracer.

If you agree, the Contact Tracer will send you a unique passcode by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.

It is your choice to do this, and you can complete the process later if needed.

Only the Contact Tracing Team can issue upload codes for people who get COVID-19. If you do not have an authorised test which provides a high degree of certainty that you have the COVID-19, you will not be able to use this function on the app.

## The call back from Contact Tracing
Jersey has an excellent Contact Tracing Team who are available to give help and support to everyone who is diagnosed with COVID-19 and to everyone who is potentially a direct contact of an infected person.

When you get an exposure alert it means you may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 who could have put you at risk. As a potentially infected person, the Contact Tracing Team will discuss your individual situation and may offer you a test.

The call back function allows you to request a call from the Contact Tracing Team immediately upon the receipt of an exposure alert. By storing your mobile phone number in the app, the app is prepared to automatically send the request when you get the alert. Your phone number is only sent to the Contact Tracing Team if you get an exposure alert, it stays security stored on your phone until then. 

## Using Bluetooth to detect proximity
During the app set-up process you’ll be asked to give the app permission to use the Exposure Notification Services on 3your phone. Bluetooth always needs to remain on for Exposure Notifications to work.

The app uses the strength of the received Bluetooth signal to estimate the distance between two devices with the app installed. The apps communicate over Bluetooth regularly, and can also estimate the length of time two app users were close to each other. The app has been designed to make the best use of Bluetooth technology, even though Bluetooth wasn’t originally designed to fulfil this function.

The app will be able to calculate if you have been too close for too long to someone who has COVID-19. Initially, too close for too long means closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes, this may change in accordance with Public Health advice. Most of the time the app will provide an accurate estimate of the distance between you and the other app user, but this part of the system is not perfect due to interference in the Bluetooth signals caused by environmental factors. 
That’s why we use two methods of contact tracing - our Contact Tracing Team and the Jersey COVID Alert app. Using the app is an extra tool to help contain outbreaks of COVID-19 in Jersey. 

## How Random IDs work
The app uses the Exposure Notification System (ENS) developed by Apple and Google, which is now present within the operating system of modern smartphones. The ENS allows nearby phones to share anonymous, Random IDs using Bluetooth. This is done by the Exposure Notification Service within your device, not the app.

The anonymous codes are made up of letters and numbers. You never see them, and they cannot be used to identify users or their phones.

Your device records all the Random IDs that it sees in a rolling 14-day period securely within the operating system of the device. If another user becomes unwell and publishes their Random IDs, your device will check to see if their IDs match any of the ones stored on your device. If a match is found, your device’s operating system will tell the app that there was a match and the length of time and distance related to the event when you got the matching Random IDs. The app will then decide whether the event was for long enough and close enough to put you at risk. If you are at risk, the app will send you an exposure alert.

Using a Random ID means any information about close contact events is collected anonymously. No one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the Contact Tracing Team and the technical team running the app.

The app and other app users will **never** know:

* your identity or the identities of anyone you met
* your location or movements
* the identity of people with COVID-19

## Why you can’t order a test via the app
Adding functionality into the app to allow you to book a test would require knowing who you are in advance of the test. This means the app would need to collect and process personal information which is not strictly necessary given the other options available to book a test. At present the Government of Jersey is offering tests via the Hospital, GPs, at the Airport and Harbour, and via the Coronavirus Helpline on +1534 44 55 66

## Why the app doesn’t use QR codes
The aim of exposure notification is to identify when you might have been too near someone for too long, so that if that person later turns out to have COVID-19, you could have been exposed. To do that, we don’t need to know where you are, or who you are. 
Using QR codes to create a diary of places you’ve visited is a good idea to assist with recalling your recent activities, if you run a venue you can implement this system with local providers.

See local [contact tracing providers](https://www.digital.je/connected-jersey/digital-contact-tracing-tools/). 

# Settings on your device

## Mobile data use
The app uses about 1MB of data per week. This is about the same amount of data you would use for 6 minutes browsing the internet. 
The app does not need to use mobile data to exchange Random IDs with nearby app users, but you will need to connect to the internet over WiFi or using mobile data at least once per day to allow the app to check the secure app servers for any matching Random IDs uploaded by people with COVID-19.

## Battery life
Using the app should not make a noticeable difference to the battery life of healthy phones. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy, which is the same technology used by smartwatches or wireless earphones and is designed to be energy efficient.

### If your phone uses battery optimisation
The core Exposure Notification Services will continue to work, and will exchange Random IDs with other phones nearby. However, without background operations, the app cannot check for new exposures.

If possible, we recommend that you turn off battery optimisation for the app. If you can’t turn off battery optimisation for the app, please open it once per day to allow the app to check for updates.

## You don’t need to keep your phone unlocked
The app will continue working in the background even with the app is not open or the phone is locked. You just need to have Bluetooth and Exposure Notification enabled, this happens automatically when you set up the app.

## Age restrictions for the App
Children under the age of 16 will not be able to use the app. In the app set-up you will need to declare that you are 16 or older before continuing. This is because the medical age of consent for health and contact tracing in Jersey is 16. 
However, 13 is the Digital Age of Consent in Jersey and we recognise that there are lots of young people between 13 and 16 with a smartphone who might want to use the app. We are looking into ways the app could be made available to users who are 13 or older and will release an update if a solution can be found. 

## What the “Covid-19 Exposure Logging” notifications on iOS mean 
This is a notification from the Exposure Notification System (ENS) in the phone’s operating system. It means that the Jersey COVID Alert app is using the ENS correctly. It does not mean that you're at risk of getting COVID-19. Your device has detected matching Random IDs, but the event was not for long enough or you were not close enough to put you at risk. You may have passed someone on the street or in a queue for a short period of time who was later diagnosed. You don’t need to do anything if you receive one of these notifications.

## iPhone Settings
In general, you should not need to adjust the iOS settings, here is a short guide. Exposure Notification settings are found in Settings > Exposure Notifications.

### View Exposures in App
This will open the Jersey COVID Alert and show you any exposure alert notifications.

### Exposure Logging Status
When “Active” this indicates the Exposure Notification Service in your device’s operating system is on and working correctly. The Exposure Checks log is a list of when the app has asked the Exposure Notification Service to check for exposures, requests will only come from the Jersey COVID Alert app.

### Set active region 
This should automatically be set to Jersey. If not, click “Active Region”, choose “Add Another Region” and choose “Jersey”.
Active Region is also for use when you have multiple Exposure Notification apps on your phone, for example if you spend a month or more in another country or region which has its own app.

### Share Exposure Information 
This is what gives the Exposure Notification Service permission to share exposures with the Jersey COVID Alert app, not another contact tracing app on your phone (if you have more than one). For the app to work, this needs to be on.

### Share travel status
This is not available yet for Jersey as no other national apps are compatible with the Jersey COVID Alert.

### Share a Diagnosis in Jersey COVID Alert App
This button opens the app, you will then need to select “Diagnosed with COVID-19?” on the home page. This is only for use when you are informed that you have COVID-19 after a diagnostic test. The Contact Tracing Team will call you if this happens.

### Why the app does not appear in Bluetooth Settings
Apps that have permission to use Bluetooth will appear in Settings>Privacy>Bluetooth. The Jersey COVID Alert app is using the Exposure Notification Services which includes Bluetooth and other features, not just Bluetooth on its own.

## Android Settings
In general, you should not need to adjust the Google settings, here is a short guide. Exposure Notification settings are found in Settings > Google > COVID-19 Support.

## Use Exposure Notifications
This is the control to turn on the Exposure Notification Services, for the app to work this needs to be on.

## Exposure checks
This can be accessed with your device passcode (on Samsung), and is a list of when the app has asked the Exposure Notification Service to check for exposures, requests will only come from the Jersey COVID Alert app.

# Data and privacy

## How the app protects your privacy
Privacy-by-design has underpinned all aspects of the app development. The Exposure Notification Service design was carefully developed by Google, Apple and a variety of academic institutions to protect your privacy. The focus of the Exposure Notification Service is on estimating the proximity between two devices over time. We can then ensure that you are notified when you have been near to someone who has COVID-19 and that you receive up to date advice and, if you choose to supply your phone number, information and support from the Contact Tracing Team. GPS and location data or any other data stored on your phone is not of interest and would not contribute to the goal of alerting you if you have been near someone who has COVID-19.

* no unnecessary data
* no unnecessary permissions
* no data sharing
* no tracking 
* no personal data needed to sign in
* encrypted connections
* encrypted data storage
* always your choice – the app is voluntary.

Read about [privacy and how we use your data](https://covidalert.gov.je/data-and-privacy)

## No personal data is shared without your consent
The only strictly required data about you that is needed for the app to work is an IP address to allow the app to communicate with the app servers, for example to fetch the latest statistics. Your IP address is only handled by networking equipment needed for internet communication and is never used by the app or the app servers for any other purpose.

There is an optional call back request feature which will enable the Jersey Contact Tracing Team to call you if you receive an exposure alert. Your phone number is stored securely on your phone and is only sent to the Contact Tracing Team when the alert arrives. 
The Random IDs exchanged by the Exposure Notification Services on your phone with other phones nearby are completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you, your location or anyone you are with.

## The App Data Protection Impact Assessment
A comprehensive Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been completed and approved by the Government of Jersey Data Protection Officer and the Jersey Office of the Information Commissioner. The DPIA may be accessed [here](https://github.com/StatesOfJersey/Jersey-COVID-Alert-Documentation/blob/master/Jersey%20COVID%20Alert%20-%20DPIA.pdf)

## GDPR compliance and EU Commission Regulations 
The Jersey COVID Alert app was built in accordance with EU guidelines and has received approval from the Jersey Information Commissioner.
On 15 April 2020, the European Commission published recommendations specifically related to mobile Applications designed to support contact tracing in response to COVID-19.

Because of concerns that such apps could potentially affect the privacy of EU citizens, a further paper was published by the European Commission on 16th April with guidance on data protection and apps developed to support the COVID-19 response in Member States. 
The key messages from these documents are:

* use of contact tracing apps should be voluntary 
* data privacy rights for EU citizens must be respected, even during the pandemic.

## No law or regulation change was needed
Because the app is voluntary and does not process personal information, there was no need to change any regulations or laws. The app operates entirely within the letter and spirit of Jersey’s current laws and regulations.

## Why the app is "decentralised" while still having a management server
The data is decentralised because all privacy-sensitive information is stored on your phone, not held centrally. The design is also called “decentralised” because there is no central point of trust for security and privacy. All critical operations, i.e. creating anonymous identifiers and matching observations, are done locally on each phone. Anyone trying to hack the app would not gain any sensitive information by compromising the management server.

## Publicly accessible information from the app
The information provided back to the Contact Tracing Team from the app includes the following aggregated statistics. The app does not know and cannot share the identity of app users.

* total number of users who open the app at least once per day
* total number of downloads per day
* total number of users who drop out during on boarding
* total number of users who Leave or delete the app
* total number of users who have Exposure Alerts enabled
* total daily number of exposure alerts generated
* total number of app users who uploaded random codes

Anonymous and aggregated data may be made available to the public through the existing coronavirus information channels and will follow the same approach to reporting other coronavirus statistics.

See more [statistics about coronavirus in Jersey](https://www.gov.je/Health/Coronavirus/Pages/CoronavirusCases.aspx)

## The App does not use location services
Geographical location information is not needed to know whether you have been near to someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.

In traditional contact tracing, the location and movements of an infected person are analysed to identify other individuals who might be at risk. The Jersey COVID Alert app uses Bluetooth to accurately and securely detect the presence of other people, without needing to know who you are, or where you are.

The use of Bluetooth to detect proximity relies on the theory that transmission of SARA-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, occurs through the close contact route, irrespective of the physical location. This is supported by current research from the World Health Organisation, who said in a situation report published on 9 July, 2020: “Current evidence suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily between people through direct, indirect, or close physical contact with infected people through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions, or through their respiratory droplets, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. Some outbreak reports related to indoor crowded spaces have suggested the possibility of aerosol transmission, combined with droplet transmission, for example, during choir practice, in restaurants or in fitness classes. Respiratory droplets from infected individuals can also land on objects, creating fomites (contaminated surfaces). As environmental contamination has been documented by many reports, it is likely that people can also be infected by touching these surfaces and touching their eyes, nose or mouth before cleaning their hands.”

# Health benefits and clinical purpose

## How the app will help
If you’re healthy, the app will anonymously warn you if you have been near someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19. The warning is called an exposure alert and will be presented as a notification in the app on your phone. If you choose, you can ask the Contact Tracing Team to call you for specific advice and support if you get an exposure alert.

If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, the app lets you anonymously warn people you have recently been near to before you became aware that you were infectious. Only people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can do this with the support of the Contact Tracing Team.

## Fomite (contaminated surfaces) or airborne transmission
Fomite transmission is transmission through the surfaces of objects, it likely plays an important role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 the virus which causes COVID-19 (see WHO statement above). Exposure notification specifically focuses on proximity between people and will only be able to capture fomite transmission to the extent that the object was part of a close contact event.

The exposure notification system will only capture transmission by aerosols that remain suspended in the air for some time (not large droplets which fall), to the extent that the people involved in the transmission were in close proximity to each other.

## Evidence supporting exposure notification apps
There is an extensive programme of research and development underway internationally to ensure that the exposure notification science and principles are sound. 
While the theoretical basis for the app is excellent, there are some real-world factors that make the app less effective (less than 100% adoption, for example). Evidence from other countries who launched an app earlier in the pandemic response has shown a slight positive impact and supports the use of an exposure notification app alongside traditional contact tracing.

The Government of Jersey’s view is that any tool that can help to protect our community at low cost and without compromising people’s privacy is worth using. We expect the app to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of contact tracing procedures and help reduce the number of new infections from each index case.
Read the [Swiss report on exposure notification effectiveness](https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/swisscovid_efficacy/blob/master/SwissCovid_efficacy_MS.pdf)
Read the [Oxford study on exposure notification effectiveness](https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2020-04-16-digital-contact-tracing-can-slow-or-even-stop-coronavirus-transmission-and-ease-us-out-of-lockdown)

## Notification reliability 
The reliability of the notifications depends on several factors. Using Bluetooth to estimate the distance between two devices is prone to interference from environmental objects. Interference in the Bluetooth signal can sometimes make it appear that a far-away phone is nearer than it is, and the opposite, that a nearby phone appears further away. The Bluetooth system also can’t know that another phone which appears close is actually on the other side of an impermeable divider (a glass cubicle or plasterboard wall), which prevents transmission of the virus, but still looks like a close physical contact event.

Because these types of errors are predictable, we can configure the risk assessment calculation to different levels of sensitivity. At the time of writing in September 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases was low in Jersey, and the risk calculation has been set to low sensitivity, which means that some exposures may not be captured. However, if COVID-19 cases increase, the sensitivity of the risk calculation can also increase to reduce the chance of missing an exposure event.

The calibration of the risk assessment calculation will be managed in line with the Jersey Safe Exit Framework, and overseen by a professional advisory board.

## Uptake and the number of people using the App
The more people that use the app, the more effective it will be. The app can’t detect other people nearby if they don’t have the app. 
A review of available research and published international reports has found that the target adoption rates that have been quoted for apps like this vary a lot (from 15 to 60% of the population), and the use of evidence-informed targets is mixed.

We expect that every additional contact that the app can identify will enhance our existing contact tracing processes. As part of the development process, user experience research has been conducted to identify factors that lead to drop-off and the team are continuously monitoring uptake and drop-off.

## Why symptom logging isn’t in the App
The first version of the app is designed to be as simple as possible and use the bare minimum of data.Other countries are not able to give their citizens the same level of support through their Contact Tracing Teams so they have to rely on the app and other online tools to get information from potentially infected people. In Jersey, every person with an exposure alert or who has COVID-19 can get support from the Jersey Contact Tracing Team. This means that we don’t have to use the app to collect that data when it is needed. Finally, only about 50% of cases have identifiable symptoms so collecting symptom data could potentially result in a large volume of data not related to COVID-19 that we’re not interested in.

If you are worried about your health or think you may have symptoms related to COVID-19, please call the [Coronavirus Helpline on +44 (0)1534 44 55 66](tel:+441534445566).

# App Transparency

## Open Access Code
This is a fully transparent project, the source code for the Jersey COVID Alert app is available for you to inspect on [GitHub](https://github.com/StatesOfJersey/Jersey-COVID-Alert).

If you have found a bug, please email us at covidalert[at]gov.je with “Bug detected” in the subject and full details of the issue including attempts to reproduce it and screenshots if possible. If you are a developer and want to help, we ask that you focus your efforts on [the Covid Green codebase](https://github.com/covidgreen) which is managed by the Linux Foundation for Public Health and is accepting pull requests in full open development.

If you are a security researcher and have found a vulnerability or problem, please email covidalert[at]gov.je with *“Responsible Disclosure”* in the subject. 

## The app programme 
The Jersey COVID Alert App is part of the Test and Trace Programme, put in place by the Government of Jersey to protect and support islanders during the Coronavirus Pandemic.

The Research and Development for the app was done by Digital Jersey and Digital Health, working closely with the Contact Tracing Team, and supported by other relevant departments such as the Law Officers’ Department and Modernisation and Digital.

In operation, the App will be managed by Modernisation and Digital and the Contact Tracing Team, with support from other relevant departments.

Digital Jersey and Digital Health will stay involved in the App through the Jersey COVID Alert App Advisory Board which oversees all major changes and updates after launch.

## How Jersey companies were involved in the app
All the designs, animations and videos, all content (including translations) and promotional material was produced by people working in Jersey. The app was also security tested by a Jersey company and by volunteers from several Jersey businesses.

The choice to use the Irish company NearForm for the core app development using the Exposure Notification Services was based on their experience producing very similar apps for the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Gibraltar. At the time of commissioning the Google Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) Services released by Apple and Google were in beta testing and very few development companies within the UK had demonstrable expertise.  NearForm also have a close working relationship with Apple and Google and together with other GAEN Implementers we can help shape how the GAEN Services develop so that they serve both users and Public Health bodies better in the future.

## Why the NHS App is not suitable for Jersey
Jersey’s Health Service and Hospital is provided by the Government of Jersey, not the National Health Service (NHS) of the United Kingdom. The Jersey Public Health Authority is providing specific advice to people living in Jersey tailored to the circumstances on Jersey, not what is occurring in the UK.

The NHS services built into the NHS app, such as requesting a test or authorising a diagnosis are not integrated with the Jersey Health service or the Jersey COVID Alert app and will not function as intended.

If you use the NHS app also bear in mind that your data may be managed by the UK government according to their rules and outside the control of the Government of Jersey. 

# International and Travel

## Other countries 
Many other countries in Europe have released or are planning to release an Exposure Notification app, including England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland. Other counties around the world have released COVID-19 apps which do not use the Exposure Notification System and have different public heath regimes in place.

Most of the Exposure Notification apps are published globally to allow anyone living in or travelling through a country to download and use the country’s app, no matter what nationality the person holds. However, at the time of writing in October 2020 you must in the country that released the app in order to have an official test and upload your Random IDs if you get COVID-19.

We do not recommend using another country’s app in Jersey as your data will be governed by different laws and the app may contain health advice which is not relevant for Jersey. See which countries are deploying Exposure Notification on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_Notification)


## Short trips abroad (less than 2 weeks)
First check whether the Jersey COVID Alert app is compatible with the app in your destination country, if any (see list SECTION LINK List of countries with compatible apps). 
If you are travelling to a country with a compatible app, you will still be protected by the Jersey COVID Alert.

If you are travelling to a country without a compatible app, we do not advise you to use the destination country’s app. This is because you may be asked to provide personal information and your data will be managed outside of Jersey, and possibly the EU.

In order to avoid roaming charges, you may wish to disable the Exposure Notification Service while travelling in a country without a compatible app.

## Long trips or residency in another country
If you are moving to another country or will be staying in the country for a long period of time, then you may wish to use the local app in order to access the country’s health services and receive relevant health advice issued in the local app.

## List of countries with compatible apps
By ensuring each national app is compatible with others, the system will help citizens travel freely between participating nations in the future, in the knowledge that the protection offered by their contact tracing app will work as they cross borders.

At the time of writing in early October there are plans to make the English (including Wales), Scottish, Northern Irish and Republic of Ireland apps compatible with each other in late Autumn. Check here for updates.

Guernsey does not have an app.

## Mobile data use abroad
If you are travelling to a country with a compatible app (see list SECTION LINK List of countries with compatible apps), you can continue to use the Jersey COVID Alert. You will continue to receive alerts if the app detects that you have been near someone recently diagnosed with COVID-19.

If you are using mobile data while roaming and have given the app permission to access the internet over mobile data, be aware that the app’s data usage may increase your bill. Consider turning off mobile data for the app except for a daily check in, or consider whether you can use Wi-Fi to avoid excessive roaming charges.

For further information about roaming and data charges, check your mobile provider.

# Workplace advice
## For employers
The Jersey COVID Alert app is part of Jersey’s COVID-19 response. Islanders are being encouraged to sign up for the app. The new app complements but does not replace the existing Contact Tracing Service.

The alert means that an exposure to someone with COVID-19 is likely but not 100% certain, so caution is recommended. Employees who have an exposure alert should discuss their personal situation with the Contact Tracing Team to review their level of exposure and assess whether they should self-isolate or not. The emphasis is on working with the individual as exposure alerts on the app are not legally enforceable orders to self-isolate.

We would ask all employers to:

* encourage and support employees to use the app – but not make it a requirement
* continue to follow existing public health workplace guidance to ensure a COVID-19 safe workplace
* encourage staff to look out for symptoms and request a test and isolate as soon as they develop any COVID-19-related symptoms
* continue to support employees needing to self-isolate, whether notified through the app or otherwise

## For employees
The Jersey COVID Alert app is an entirely voluntary app, it is always your choice to use it. 

If you get an exposure alert – please discuss your situation with the Contact Tracing Team who will assess whether you need to self-isolate or not. If you do need to isolate, the Contact Tracing Team will provide you with the necessary evidence for your employer. 

## For GPs
If a patient presents at the surgery or calls in with an exposure alert, it does not mean they have COVID-19. The recommendation is to limit exposure to others as the patient’s phone has detected that they’ve been near to someone with COVID-19 who may have put them at risk. If the patient contacts the Contact Tracing Team they will be interviewed and offered a test.
We do not recommend that patients use the Pause function while visiting the surgery.

## For healthcare professionals
We recommend using the Pause function only when wearing medical grade PPE in a clinical setting.
